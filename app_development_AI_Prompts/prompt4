Design the tutor onboarding flow.

Steps:
1. Tutor signs up
2. Tutor fills profile form
3. Profile is saved as "pending approval"
4. Tutor cannot be visible to parents until approved by admin

Create:
- Tutor profile form fields
- Validation rules (basic only)
- Confirmation screen

Keep UX very simple.
