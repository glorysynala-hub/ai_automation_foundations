You are helping me build a simple MVP web app.

App name: Home Tuition Connect

Goal:
Build a clean, easy-to-use web app that connects parents with home tutors.

Constraints:
- I am a non-technical founder
- No custom code unless absolutely required
- Keep everything simple and minimal
- This is an MVP for validation, not a full product

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Lovable AI
- Backend: Supabase
- Web app only (mobile responsive)

Do not add advanced features.
Confirm understanding and outline the app structure before building.
